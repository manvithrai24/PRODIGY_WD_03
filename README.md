🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Web Game: A Fun New Project Completed! 🎮
I'm excited to announce that I've completed another Task/Project during my Web Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech! I developed a Tic-Tac-Toe Game that includes dynamic player name input, interactive gameplay, and even a leaderboard! 🏆

Key features of this project include: 
🔹 A responsive UI with background images and custom styles using CSS.
🔹 JavaScript logic for real-time game updates and determining winners/draws.
🔹 Local storage integration to maintain a leaderboard and enhance user experience.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and explore new challenges in web development.
Big thanks to the team at Prodigy InfoTech for their support and guidance! 🙌
I’m excited to continue learning and taking on more projects! 🚀
